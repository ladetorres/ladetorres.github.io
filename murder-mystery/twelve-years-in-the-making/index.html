            A servant of the Mountain lodge is threatening
            to expose the <b>Aristocrat</b> by revealing to everyone that her son is actually his.
            <br>
            <br>
            In response, he brings the drunk Marksman into the Servant's Quarters, who then passes out. The Aristocrat gets his rifle and
            shoots her. Everyone hears the sound, and discovers the Marksman in the room.
            <br>
            <br>
            Too drunk to remember anything, he thinks it was him who shot the servant.
            <br>
            <br>
            The <b>Forest Ranger</b> drives her to the hospital on his SUV. Heavily drunk, he is swerving badly
            on the way. She didn't make it in time.
            <br>
            <br>
            The <b>Magistrate</b> keeps the victim's family from coming out or filing a case.
            The marksman, out of guilt, flees into a friary and eventually became a <b>Travelling Missionary</b>.
            <br>
            <br>
            All this time, the <b>Groundskeeper</b> knew about the Aristocrat's affair and the kid, but kept mum.
            Meanwhile, the then Maître d' saw it was the Aristocrat who killed the servant, but never said anything to
            anyone, until her deathbed at her daughter, the new <b>Maître d'</b>.

            In an effort to make things right, The Maître d' tipped off the local <b>Columnist</b>
            of what she just learned about the Lodge twelve years ago.
            <br>
            <br>
            He managed to befriend the Aristocrat, and convinced him
            to reunite the everyone involved one last time...
