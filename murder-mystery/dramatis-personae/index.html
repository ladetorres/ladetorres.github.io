              The owner of the Mountain Lodge can be very temperamental, one can never tell
              when it's a good moment to chat.
              <br>
              <br>
              On one end, he's a highly-educated, well-mannered gentleman, very kind to his employees.
              And sometimes a little too much...
              <br>
              <br>
              On a bad day, he's ruthless, bound to fits of rage, maybe even be capable of anything.

              Her light and upbeat personality conceals the fact that if
              anything has ever happened in the Lodge, she knows, but won't tell.
              <br>
              <br>
              For generations, her family are the caretakers of the lodge, even
              after changes of owners.
              She had known the Lodge with her life, the garden and bushes
              and the very soil it sits on.
              <br>
              <br>
              Whatever it takes to keep the Lodge standing, she's for it.

              The Ranger had been the protector of the woods for all his life, and had
              earned the respect of the town.
              <br>
              <br>
              A naturally social and friendly familiar place around town, the Ranger
              is a person with beaming outlook. Or was.
              <br>
              <br>
              For years, the Ranger had lived as a recluse, shunned himself
              alone in the middle of the jungle, sparking a wild variety of rumors as to why.

              Anyone would mistake the Missionary for a hitman or an ex-military
              for his stern expression and calculated composure.
              <br>
              <br>
              He had been on war-torn countries in the last twelve years preaching
              the words of God, and some suspect a more personal reason.

              Right after her mother died, the Maître immediately took over of
              overseeing the guests in the Mountain Lodge, despite vocal resistance at

              <br>
              <br>
              Something her mother confided to her had convinced this new Maître to come work in the Lodge.

              Now a designated voice of the law, she had been a dominant figure,
              and has been known to sway against the laws of men from time to time.

              Rumor has it that money ain't much there no more.
